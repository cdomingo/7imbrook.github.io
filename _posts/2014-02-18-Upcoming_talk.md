In about a month I will be giving a talk on [ Objective-c ] for the [Society of Software Engineers](http://sse.se.rit.edu). I don't have a set domain for my talk yet so I want some ideas! [Tweet](http://twitter.com/7imbrook) me with [#objcsse](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23objcsse) or send and email to [timbrook480@gmail.com](mailto:timbrook480@gmail.com?subject=RE:SSETalk) with your ideas. It's not gonna be a beginner talk and I'd like to get into some advanced topics along with fun gems and obscure topics. If there's anything you want to know more about let me know. Thanks!

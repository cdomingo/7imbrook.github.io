My name is Michael Timbrook and I am a Software Engineer!

I am currently attending the Rochester Institute of Technology studying Software Engineering along with working toward a minor in Computer Engineering. I am currently employed under Dr. Stephanie Ludi doing undergrad research developing a new accessibility framework for text input on iOS (yes a keyboard) along with other projects that can be found on our github [RITAccess](https://github.com/ritaccess).

My drive for software to create an elegant systems, that are maintainable and accessible. While at the same time pushing the ways we interact with the world. This site is a place where I hope that inteligible discutions about software concepts and cool language features can happen.

As an avid Objective-C developer, I have become accustomed to the ways of the smalltalk style object system and the power of the runtime. For the past three years, I’ve learned something new every week that I’ve spent nose deep in projects. Everything from powerful language features to simple shortcuts, code style, and documentation. Techniques for working with teams and how to keep your teammates sanity in check. I want to share with you how I work.

A love for Objective-C, this is a place where I talk about why Objective-C is awesome. It's also a place to share my contributions to the community. Beyond coding and software engineering, I love playing ultimate frisbee and taking photos. I’m working on a short film in my spare time to fuel my filmmaking side as well.  I'm also a coffee prick, can't help it sometimes.

As an avid objective-c developer I have become accustomed to the ways of the smalltalk style object system and the power of the runtime. For the past three years I’ve learned something new every week I’ve spent nose deep into projects. Everything from powerful language features to simple shortcuts, code style, and documentation. Techniques for working with teams and how to keep your teammates sanity in check. I want to share with you how I work.

A love for Objective-C this is a place where I talk about why Objective-C is awesome and add my contibutions to the community.

My name is Michael Timbrook and I am a Software Engineer. I am currently attending the Rochester Institute of Technology studying Software Engineering along with working toward a minor in Computer Engineering. I am currently employed under Dr. Stephanie Ludi doing undergrad research developing a new accessibility framework for text input on iOS along with other projects that can be found on our github [RITAccess](https://github.com/ritaccess). This is a site where I can post about what I love and discuss with reader on fun topics. My drive for software to create an elegant systems, that are maintainable and accessible. While at the same time pushing the ways we interact with the world.
